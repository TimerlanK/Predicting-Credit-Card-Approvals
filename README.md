## Project Description
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. </br>
Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example.</br> Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. </br>
In this project, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.
